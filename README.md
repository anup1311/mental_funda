StockDocs Scanner & Analyzer - v2.0
This Chrome extension, coupled with a Vercel serverless backend, is a comprehensive financial analysis toolkit for Screener.in. It intelligently downloads financial documents, renders interactive performance charts, and provides AI-powered analysis of a company's financials.

Core Features
ðŸ“„ Smart Document Downloader:

Automatically detects Annual Reports (10y), Concall Transcripts (5y), and Investor Presentations (5y).

Uses a hybrid download engine: packages documents into a ZIP file via a serverless backend, with a graceful client-side fallback for restricted sources like BSE India.

Generates clean, descriptive filenames (e.g., RELIANCE_AnnualReport_FY2024.pdf).

ðŸ“Š Interactive Financial Charts:

Extracts yearly and quarterly financial data from on-page tables.

Uses Chart.js to inject beautiful, interactive charts visualizing trends in Sales, Net Profit, and OPM%.

ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Analysis (Gemini):

Sends extracted financial data to a secure backend running Google's Gemini model.

Generates a qualitative analysis of the company's performance, strengths, and weaknesses.

Ensures your API key is kept secure on the backend and is never exposed to the browser.

Setup and Deployment
Follow these steps to deploy the entire solution.

Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key
Go to Google AI Studio.

Click "Create API key in new project".

Copy the generated API key. You will need it for the Vercel setup.

Step 2: GitHub & Vercel Deployment
Create a GitHub Repository: Push the entire project structure to a new repository on your GitHub account.

Import to Vercel:

Go to your Vercel Dashboard, click "Add New..." -> "Project".

Import the GitHub repository you just created.

Configure Vercel Project:

Vercel should auto-detect the settings. No changes are needed for the framework or build commands.

Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your new Vercel project.

Click on "Environment Variables" in the left-hand menu.

Create a new variable:

Name: GEMINI_API_KEY

Value: Paste the API key you copied from Google AI Studio.

Ensure the variable is available to all environments (Production, Preview, Development).

Click "Save".

Deploy: Go to the "Deployments" tab and trigger a new deployment (or redeploy the latest one) to apply the environment variable.

Copy Vercel URL: Once deployed, copy your production URL (e.g., https://your-project.vercel.app).

Step 3: Configure and Load the Chrome Extension
Set Backend URL: Open extension/background.js and update the placeholder URL with your Vercel domain:

// Replace with your Vercel project's domain
const VERCEL_DOMAIN = "https://your-project-name.vercel.app";

Set Host Permissions: Open extension/manifest.json. In the host_permissions array, replace the placeholder with your Vercel domain:

"host_permissions": [
  "https://www.screener.in/company/*",
  "https://your-project-name.vercel.app/*"
],

Load the Extension:

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions.

Enable "Developer mode".

Click "Load unpacked" and select the local extension folder from the project.

The extension is now installed and fully configured.

How to Use
Navigate to a company page on Screener.in.

Click the extension icon to open the popup.

To Download Documents: Use the "Downloader" tab. Select documents and click the download button.

To View Charts & Analysis:

Go to the "Analysis & Charts" tab in the popup.

Click the "Inject Charts & Analysis UI" button. This will add the new modules to the page below the main price chart.
